# Semi - supervised label for TensorFlow Object Detection

Welcome to this project! This is a fork from TensorFlow Model Garden (https://github.com/tensorflow/models), to simplify for those who are already familiar with that repository.

# Propose
This project is for helping you to create or labeled dataset in the object detection problem you are solving. This is done by some algorithms added to the original repo that has the intention to create new labels from your model.

# How it Works
