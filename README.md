Welcome to this project! This is a fork from TensorFlow Model Garden (https://github.com/tensorflow/models), to simplify for those who are already familiar with that repository. 

# Propose
This project helps you to create your labeled dataset in the object detection problem you are solving. This is done by some algorithms added in the original repository that has the intention to create new labels from your model.

The quick explanation is here: ''

A most detailed one is here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343167804_Semi-supervised_approach_to_auto-label_images_in_object_detection

# Quick Start

- Fork this repository
- Enter in the *research/object_detection* folder
- Replace the images and XML files in *train_images* and *test_images* folder by yours.
- Added all your unlabeled data into the *unlabeled_data* folder
- Push your changes
- Go to the Google Colab and play run button: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1srnHOXFv779IGT0lKKGbTn8J-5dGSAX_/view?usp=sharing
- That's it.
